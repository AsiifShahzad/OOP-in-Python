    "# Why OOP\n",
    "We use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure code efficiently by encapsulating data and behavior into objects.We use OOP to divide a large system into classes, allowing different developers to work on separate parts independently, improving collaboration and maintainability. It ensures reusability (inheritance), modularity (encapsulation), flexibility (polymorphism), and abstraction, making complex systems scalable, reducing redundancy, and simplifying updates."

However, if it encounters a function or class definition, it does not execute them immediately; instead, it registers them in memory so that when they are called later in the script, Python knows they exist. After registering functions and classes, Python continues executing any remaining statements. Now, if we have defined a main() function, it will be registered like any other function, but it won‚Äôt run automatically. If we call main() explicitly at the bottom of the script (usually inside if __name__ == \"__main__\":), then Python executes it just like any other function.
